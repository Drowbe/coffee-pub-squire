# Squire Quest System Todo List

## Critical Bugs (Immediate Fixes Needed)

### âœ… Completed
1. **Fix syntax error in quest pin state update** - Missing opening brace after `try` in `panel-quest.js` line 89
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - The syntax error has already been fixed. The `try` block now properly opens with `try {` on line 91.

2. **Remove duplicate event handler setup** - Objective click handlers are set up twice in `panel-manager.js`
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed by adding proper `.off()` cleanup before `.on()` in `_attachObjectiveClickHandlers` method

3. **Fix duplicate class attribute in template** - In `quest-entry.hbs` line 47
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed duplicate `class` attribute in `partials/quest-entry.hbs`

4. **Fix tray window click issue** - Clicking any open tray window (macros, effects, dice tray, etc.) makes the tray completely disappear
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed by removing problematic cleanup hooks that were triggered on every window close

5. **Fix squire tray disappearing on scene change** - The squire tray is removed from the DOM when changing scenes
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed by removing duplicate canvasReady hook that was calling PanelManager.cleanup() during scene transitions
   - **Files**: `scripts/panel-manager.js`

6. **Fix handle quest progress order and index mapping** - The handle shows objectives in reverse order (1st on top) but click events and mouseover events have them reversed
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed by removing array reversal and using correct index mapping

7. **Add pin visibility class to handle quest progress** - Mark which objectives have pins on the canvas
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Added `objective-pins-oncanvas` class for objectives with visible pins

8. **Fix handle quest data loading on scene change** - Pinned quest in handle disappears when changing scenes, handle quest items not loading properly on scene change
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Fixed by ensuring proper data loading and pin visibility checks
   - **Changes**: Added proper pin visibility logic and data loading on scene changes

### ðŸ”„ Pending
9. **Add proper error handling for tooltip data** - `getObjectiveTooltipData()` doesn't handle null/undefined cases
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Added comprehensive null checks, input validation, and error handling with graceful fallbacks
   - **Files**: `scripts/helpers.js`

## Handle Quest Progress Order & UI Issues

### âœ… Completed
7. **Add pin visibility class to handle quest progress** - Mark which objectives have pins on the canvas
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Added `objective-pins-oncanvas` class for objectives with visible pins

### âœ… Completed
10. **Fix tooltip data consistency** - Tooltip shows different data in handle vs pin (may be related to index issue)
   - **Status**: COMPLETED - Unified tooltip data using QuestParser.parseSinglePage as source of truth
   - **Files**: `scripts/helpers.js`, `scripts/quest-pin.js`
   - **Changes**: 
     - Updated `getObjectiveTooltipData` to use parser instead of manual HTML parsing
     - Removed legacy HTML parsing code from quest pin tooltip
     - All tooltips now use shared Handlebars template `tooltip-quest.hbs`
     - Added proper text transformations in JS (zero-padding, capitalization)
     - Added hidden objective override for players ("Objective Not Discovered")
     - Added "Objective Nearby" indicator for hidden objectives with pins

## Quest Visibility & Pin Management

### âœ… Completed
11. **Fix quest visibility toggle pin refresh** - When hiding/showing entire quest, function doesn't call pin refresh to change pin style for GM and hide/show pins for players
    - **Status**: COMPLETED - Added comprehensive quest visibility handling with automatic unpinning, pin appearance updates, and proper state synchronization
    - **Files**: `scripts/panel-quest.js`, `scripts/quest-pin.js`
    - **Changes**:
      - Enhanced `updateJournalEntryPage` hook to detect quest visibility changes
      - Added `_unpinHiddenQuestFromPlayers()` method for automatic unpinning
      - Added player notifications when quests are automatically unpinned
      - Enhanced pin visibility updates with proper appearance refresh
      - Fixed second ring (orange ring) display for hidden quests
      - Added proper quest state synchronization across all components
      - Added `renderQuestPanel` hook for additional pin updates

12. **Fix excludedUsers settings issue** - "coffee-pub-squire.excludedUsers" is not a registered game setting error
    - **Status**: COMPLETED - Consolidated canvasReady hooks to fix timing issue
    - **Files**: `scripts/squire.js`, `scripts/settings.js`, `scripts/panel-manager.js`, `scripts/quest-pin.js`
    - **Root Cause**: PanelManager.initialize() was called during canvasReady hook before registerSettings() completed in the ready hook
    - **Solution**: 
      - Consolidated all initialization into a single delayed call in the ready hook
      - Removed duplicate canvasReady hooks from panel-manager.js and quest-pin.js
      - Added 1-second delay to ensure settings are registered before initialization
      - Exported quest pin loading function for proper coordination
    - **Impact**: Fixed critical startup error for all users

## Code Architecture & Maintenance

### ðŸ”„ Pending
12. **Implement unified hook system** - Currently each part of Squire (panel-manager, quest-pin, panel-quest) registers its own hooks, leading to scattered logic and potential conflicts
    - **Status**: PENDING - Need to create centralized hook management system
    - **Files**: Create new `scripts/hooks.js`, refactor existing hook registrations
    - **Benefits**: 
      - Single source of truth for all hooks
      - Better coordination between modules
      - Easier debugging and maintenance
      - Reduced duplicate hook registrations
    - **Current Issues**:
      - Duplicate `canvasReady` and `canvasSceneChange` hooks across files
      - Scattered hook logic makes maintenance difficult
      - Potential for hook conflicts or race conditions
