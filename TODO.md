# Squire Tray TODO List

## üö® Critical Issues (Fix First)

### Tray State Management
- [ ] **FIXED** ~~Tray opens/closes on token changes when it should stay in current state~~
- [ ] **FIXED** ~~Content not updating to new token data after token changes~~
- [ ] **FIXED** ~~Tray collapse/expand functionality broken after token changes~~
- [ ] **FIXED** ~~Tray automatically expanding/flashing on token selection~~

### Animation Issues
- [ ] **BROKEN** Expand animation: tray fades out and in with small slide from bottom instead of sliding open
- [ ] **WORKING** Collapse animation: tray slides closed correctly
- [ ] **WORKING** Pin/unpin functionality: tray stays pinned and shifts Foundry UI correctly

## üîß Content Update Issues

### Favorites System
- [ ] **BROKEN** Clicking favorites adds items to favorites but doesn't update the "favorite" heart icon in their actual category panels
- [ ] **BROKEN** Handle favorite logic: currently adds ALL favorited items to handle, but should only add items marked for handle inclusion

### Panel Functionality
- [ ] **BROKEN** Manual refresh button on codex panel doesn't seem to do anything
- [ ] **BROKEN** Feather icon in party view opens character sheet AND changes tray to that actor (should only open sheet)

## üéØ UI/UX Improvements

### Tray Handle
- [ ] **IMPROVEMENT** Make tray handle clickable only on chevron or character panel container - too easy to mis-click other elements

### Content Transitions
- [ ] **PLANNED** Implement fade transitions for content changes while keeping tray stable
- [ ] **PLANNED** Quick fade out ‚Üí fade in for token data changes
- [ ] **PLANNED** No animation for panel visibility toggles (filters, categories)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Code Quality

### Panel-Focused Updates
- [ ] **DEFERRED** Optimize panel-focused updates (deferred until tray state management is stable)
- [ ] **DEFERRED** Implement targeted content updates without full tray recreation

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] **PLANNED** Remove legacy code from our fixes
- [ ] **PLANNED** Modularize panel-manager.js (too large, not modular enough)
- [ ] **PLANNED** Review and clean up any remaining unnecessary `updateTray()` calls

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- [x] **COMPLETED** Removed unnecessary `updateTray()` calls from item hooks
- [x] **COMPLETED** Fixed `controlToken` hook to preserve tray state
- [x] **COMPLETED** Replaced `PanelManager.initialize()` with direct actor updates
- [x] **COMPLETED** Added `renderPanels` and `activateListeners` calls after actor changes
- [x] **COMPLETED** Fixed refresh button to prevent full tray recreation
- [x] **COMPLETED** Added explicit `this` context binding for event listeners

## üìã Next Steps Priority

1. **Fix expand animation** - Core functionality issue
2. **Fix favorites heart icons** - User experience issue
3. **Fix handle favorite logic** - Functionality issue
4. **Fix codex refresh** - Panel functionality issue
5. **Fix party view feather icon** - Unexpected behavior
6. **Improve tray handle click target** - UX improvement
7. **Implement content fade transitions** - Polish
8. **Code cleanup and modularization** - Technical debt

## üîç Investigation Needed

- [ ] Investigate why expand animation changed from sliding to fading
- [ ] Investigate favorites system to understand heart icon update mechanism
- [ ] Investigate handle favorite logic to understand inclusion criteria
- [ ] Investigate codex refresh button implementation
- [ ] Investigate party view feather icon event handling

## üìù Notes

- **Current Status**: Tray state management is working correctly after recent fixes
- **Animation Issue**: Expand animation broke during hook optimization changes
- **Favorites**: Likely related to event handling or state synchronization between panels
- **Handle Logic**: May need to review how items are marked for handle inclusion
- **Codex Refresh**: Could be missing event handler or broken refresh logic
- **Party View**: Feather icon likely has unintended side effects in event handling
