# HookManager - Correct Implementation Approach

## **The Right Way: Simple Orchestration Layer**

The HookManager should act as an **orchestration layer** where you just register a hook and a callback. It should be simple, not complex.

## **How It Should Work (Your Flow)**

```
FoundryVTT Event → HookManager → Your Callback → Your Logic
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Actor Updated → Hook Fired → Your Function → Update Health Panel
```

## **Core Principles**

### **1. Simple Registration**
```javascript
// This is what you want - simple and clean
HookManager.registerHook('updateActor', (actor, changes) => {
    // Your logic here - update health panel, etc.
    if (changes.system?.attributes?.hp) {
        PanelManager.instance?.healthPanel?.update();
    }
});
```

### **2. Automatic Data Passing**
- **FoundryVTT automatically provides the data** when hooks fire
- **You don't need to ask for this data** - it's automatic
- **No complex routing or abstraction layers needed**

### **3. Clean Separation of Concerns**
- **HookManager**: Just registers and manages hooks
- **Your Code**: Contains all the actual logic
- **No business logic in the HookManager**

## **What HookManager Should Do**

### **✅ Good: Simple Orchestration**
- Register hooks with callbacks
- Provide cleanup when module disables
- Organize hooks for visibility/debugging
- Handle hook lifecycle management

### **❌ Bad: Complex Routing**
- Don't route events between panels
- Don't embed business logic
- Don't create multiple abstraction layers
- Don't overcomplicate what should be simple

## **Example Implementation**

```javascript
export class HookManager {
    static hooks = new Map();
    
    // Simple registration - exactly what you described
    static registerHook(hookName, callback) {
        const hookId = Hooks.on(hookName, callback);
        this.hooks.set(hookName, { callback, hookId });
        return hookId;
    }
    
    // Simple cleanup
    static cleanup() {
        this.hooks.forEach((hook, name) => {
            Hooks.off(name, hook.callback);
        });
        this.hooks.clear();
    }
}
```

## **Why This Approach is Right**

1. **Simple** - Easy to understand and debug
2. **Efficient** - No unnecessary function calls or routing
3. **Maintainable** - Logic stays in the right place
4. **FoundryVTT Native** - Works with the system, not against it

## **The Problem with Complex Approaches**

Complex HookManagers with routing layers:
- Add unnecessary complexity
- Create more points of failure
- Make debugging harder
- Don't solve real problems
- Violate the principle of "keep it simple"

## **Bottom Line**

Your instinct was **100% correct**. The HookManager should be a **simple orchestration layer** that:
- Registers your callbacks
- Lets FoundryVTT handle the data passing
- Keeps your logic in your code
- Provides clean organization and cleanup

**Keep it simple. Don't overcomplicate.**
