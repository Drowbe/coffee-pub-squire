# Squire Tray TODO List

---

## Current Issues (Fix First)

### NOTES TAB
- [ ] **ENHANCEMENT** Expand and optimize this section. It needs to have a shared note, character note, and scratchpad

### CODEX TAB
- [ ] **ENHANCEMENT** Clicking a tag on a codex item should filter the codex by that tag
- [ ] **ENHANCEMENT** Need to add a "new" flag to added items that goes away at next client refresh
- [ ] **ENHANCEMENT** When dragging a token to the manual add, we need to pull the bio and put it in the description

## Remaining Issues

### Panel Functionality
- [ ] **BROKEN** Feather icon in party view opens character sheet AND changes tray to that actor (should only open sheet)

## Architecture & Code Quality

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] **PLANNED** Remove legacy code from our fixes
- [ ] **PLANNED** Modularize manager-panel.js (too large, not modular enough)
- [ ] **PLANNED** Review and clean up any remaining unnecessary `updateTray()` calls

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **INVESTIGATE** Disabled tabs still load/render all data even when hidden - consider skipping panel construction for disabled tabs

## Investigation Needed

- [ ] Investigate why expand animation changed from sliding to fading
